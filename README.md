# instrument_separation
Project work for an Audio Processing course

The objective is to implement a simple and fast method to separate a monaural audio signal into harmonic and percussive components.
The algorithm used is the one described by Ono et al in "Separation Of A Monaural Audio Signal Into Harmonic/Percussive Components By Complementary Diffusion On Spectrogram"
